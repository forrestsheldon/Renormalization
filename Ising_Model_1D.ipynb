      "Lenz (of Lenz's law) proposed the 1D model to his student Ising as his Ph.D. thesis topic, most likely as a model that should show a phase transition.  We imagine a lattice of arrows that are restricted to point either up or down.  The influence of one arrow on another is short ranged such that only neighbors are included in the sum.  If $J$ is positive, configurations in which two arrow point in the same direction are favored.  In this sense, we can consider it to be a simple model for a ferromagnet.  It's physical origins are quite interesting and I will devote some time later to compiling and discussing them.  For now though, we will focus on solving it."

      "Consider a 1D chain of N spins in the ground state.  The multiplicity of this state is 2.  The first excited state comes in the form of a kink.  This is a topological change in the system that reduces the magnetization to 0. (Think of a topological change as an excitation with a global effect.) The kinked state possesses an energy of $\\Delta E = 2J$ above the ground state and it's multiplicity is $2(N-1)$.  Considering the probabilities of the respective states, $\\frac{P_{kink}}{P_{GS}} = (N-1)e^{2\\beta J}$.  In the thermodynamic limit, the probability of an excited state with no magnetization dominates the ground state at any finite temperature.  Note that in considering the $\\beta \\to \\infty$ limit, we will have to be more careful, but we can keep leave that for later.\n",

      "This gives a single configuration, but for the partition function we want to sum over all of these.  We break this into two parts: first we sum over the internal spins.  Looking at our expression above, if we consider the sigmas as labels, this is just matrix multiplication! (It also suggests we can get higher spin partition functions by using larger matrices or even tensors!) Then we need to take a look at boundary conditions.  Note that in the expression for the first 3 spins above, the first and last spin require an extra factor to complete the partitions function.  This will have to be taken up at the end of the calculation in some ad hoc way.  If we consider periodic boundary conditions, the solution becomes quite elegant.  Our sum over the internal spins gives the matrix $T^N = T_{\\sigma_1 2}T_{23}...T_{N,\\sigma_{N+1}}$ where the first and last index are free.
