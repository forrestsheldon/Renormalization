\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Basic Percolation Problem}

Consider a finite cubic lattice where neighboring sites are not yet connected.
At every potential edge, place a bond with a probability or \textbf{concentration}
$p$. As we increase the concentration from 0, clusters that connect from the
top of the lattice to the bottom will begin to form.  As the size of the lattice
increases, the point at which a percolating cluster forms becomes more sharply
defined and in the infinite limit we can define a critical concentration
$p_c$
